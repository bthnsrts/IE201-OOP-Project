# IE201-OOP-Project
IE201 2020/21 Object Oriented Programming Project

In this course, we implemented Object Oriented design on the given simple game (Plants vs. Zombies). Use of polymorphism, inheritance and data encapsulation were encouraged throughout the project. We prepared collaboration diagrams, class diagram and necessary technical design reports. Lastly, we implemented additional changes in the game and turned it into the Matrix game!

In this game you will try to plant your agents and machines by using energy points. In this simple version you have two cards:

Machine: Creates the energy needed to plant more cards.
Agent Smith: Shoots bullets at the humans.
Energy points can be obtained by planting machines and collecting the energies they created. Humans appear on random lines from the right of the game screen and have only melee attack. However, there are two specialized humans, Neo and Morpheus. Neo can dodge the bullet by %50 chance and Morpheus gains damage power as his HP drains. You have time to place your cards until they can attack. If any human reaches the left line of your screen the game is over. The aim is to hold your defenses as long as possible.
